What is REST/RESTFul API?
	Representational State Transfer - Architectural Style Pattern/Development - 
	In Microsoft - Web API - M-Model and C-Controller Pattern

SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
	Web Services - 
		SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
			Xml + HTTP
		WSDL - Web Service Description Language [Xml]
		WSE - Web Service Enhancements

Windows Communication Foundation Service [2007]
	IPC, TCP/IP, Http, Https, P2P, Federal [Govt/Military/...] 
		Hard to configure which follows Microsoft .NET framework specifications

Why RESTFull services?

	1) It should be stateless 
	2) It should access all the resources from the server using only URI
		Example - https://api.bosch.ev/doors/designs
	3) It should not have built-in encryption 
	4) It should not have session
	5) It should use one and only one Protocol - Http
	6) It should perform CRUD operations using Http verbs - GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/MERGE/...
	7) It should return results only in JSON/XML/ATOM/OData etc formats [unlike UI]

Web API Development

	In-House/Client or Partners/Public

Create First ASP.NET Core Web API 8 application

https://localhost:7001/api/customers - [GET - Fetch list of customers] [Get() - Method]
https://localhost:7001/api/customers/2378 [GET - Fetch customer details] [Get(int id) - Method]
https://localhost:7001/api/customers - [POST - Create/Insert new customer] [Post(Customer customer)]
https://localhost:7001/api/customers - [PUT - Update existing customer] [Put(Customer customer)]
https://localhost:7001/api/customers/2378 [DELETE - Remove the customer] [Delete(int id) - Method]

Decorate every method using Http Attributes

[HttpGet]
[HttpPost]
[HttpPut]
[HttpDelete]

Controller Class - Base class for API controller is ControllerBase
	[Route("api/Customers")]
	[ApiController]


PoC  Events Management Service/API

Entities - 
	Employee
	Event
	User

RDBMS SQL Queries - 

DDL - Data Definition Language [Create/Alter/Drop/Truncate]
DML - Data Manipulation Language [Insert/Update/Delete]
DQL - Data Query Language [Select]

CQRS Pattern along with Mediator Pattern [MediatR Package]

What is CQRS?
	Command Query Responsibility Segregation Pattern
	Command - DML [Insert/Update/Delete]
	Query - DQL [Select]
